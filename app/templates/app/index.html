		<h1>Our Operation</h1>
		<p align="justify">
			We are a registered, non profit 501(c)3 organization, supported only through donations and fund raising
			efforts. â€‹The donation received through the placement of each dog, pays for the transportation and medical
			costs. We also rely heavily on the efforts of our volunteers. Without their assistance, especially the work
			of those willing to foster, we could not accomplish our goal. If YOU are willing to participate, please
			contact us.
		</p>
 		<p>
			We invite any questions you might have so feel free to send us an e-mail.
